# Entropy Mesh Simulation

This is a simulation/playground to simulate the spawning of async interoperable randomness beacons and using their outputs to construct an entropy mesh (Merkle-Clock DAG). It allows for randomness from each individual beacon to be queried as well as combined to produce re-randomized values

## Run
This is a react project. By default it runs on port 3000.
